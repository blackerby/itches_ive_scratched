# itches_ive_scratched

## Three programs I've written that actually do something useful to me.

* url2markdown - a Chrome extension that takes web page's title and url and formats them as a markdown link.
* cleanup.pl - a hasty way to put a directory's contents into folders based on the file's extension
* tlg_wotd - my first Twitter bot. Posts the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae's Word of the Day daily.
